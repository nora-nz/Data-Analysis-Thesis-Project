# Data Analysis Thesis Project: Can AI detect early biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease?

## Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, characterised by an accumulation of amyloid β protein and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, causing neuroinflammation and cell death, and leading to motor function deficits, memory loss, and eventual death. 
A combination of supervised (DeepLabCut) and unsupervised (B-SOiD) machine learning was used to extract spatiotemporal data from video files of transgenic (5XFAD) mice to identify changes in motor function and behaviour.
The main effects of genotype and sex significantly affect the average distance travelled by a mouse (118.02m in transgenic vs 100.32m in wildtype, F = 5.343, degree of freedom = 1, p = 0.037 and 120.78m in females vs 99.70m in males, F = 6.287, degree of freedom = 1, p = 0.025, respectively) and the average speed (5.86m/min in transgenic vs 5.00m/min in wildtype, F = 5.426, degree of freedom = 1, p = 0.035 and 6.07m/min in females vs 4.97m/min in males, F = 6.316, degree of freedom = 1, p = 0.025, respectively). The genotype significantly affects the percentage of time spent stationary (33.51% in FAD+ vs 37.62% in WT, F = 0.416, degree of freedom = 1, p = 0.31) and grooming (17.44% in FAD+ vs 13.49% in WT, F = 6.831, p = 0.35).
Results align with previous studies describing genotype and sex influence on hyperactivity and anxiety. However, these are not reliable biomarkers for disease prognosis because of their inapplicability to males and difficult quantification.
